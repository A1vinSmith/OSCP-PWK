# Bolt

This room is easy as pie. It doesn't need the Metasploit here since you can't rely on it for your coming oscp exam.

The payload on www.exploit-db.com is lack of indent. So get it from [here](https://github.com/A1vinSmith/Boltcms-Auth-rce-py)
Might need to install the requirement.txt if you're not using Kali.

Tips: Restart the target machine when you're facing an unexpected error.
