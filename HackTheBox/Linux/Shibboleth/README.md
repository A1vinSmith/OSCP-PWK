### ffuf Vhosts Fuzzing
```
ffuf -u "http://shibboleth.htb/" -H "Host:FUZZ.shibboleth.htb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -fc 302
```

Add them to the hosts
```

##### Vhosts vs. Sub-domains
The key difference between VHosts and sub-domains is that a VHost is basically a 'sub-domain' served on the same server and has the same IP, such that a single IP could be serving two or more different websites.

VHosts may or may not have public DNS records.

In many cases, many websites would actually have sub-domains that are not public and will not publish them in public DNS records, and hence if we visit them in a browser, we would fail to connect, as the public DNS would not know their IP. Once again, if we use the sub-domain fuzzing, we would only be able to identify public sub-domains but will not identify any sub-domains that are not public.

This is where we utilize VHosts Fuzzing on an IP we already have. We will run a scan and test for scans on the same IP, and then we will be able to identify both public and non-public sub-domains and VHosts.

### Nmap UDP the Sub-domains
##### Get running ports with rustscan
```

❯ docker pull rustscan/rustscan:latest
❯ docker run -it --rm --name rustscan rustscan/rustscan:1.10.0 10.129.187.84
```
##### Nmap the opening ports
```
❯ sudo nmap -sU -p 623 zabbix.shibboleth.htb
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-16 20:17 NZDT
Nmap scan report for zabbix.shibboleth.htb (10.129.187.84)

##### Check version and dump hashes
```
hashcat -m 7300 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
